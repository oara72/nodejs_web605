     *   "className" since "class" is a keyword in JavaScript
     * 2. All tags must close so <input type="text"> would be invalid, you'd
     *   have to do it like so <input type="text"/>
     * 3. A render function must return only one root element (this include comments and any brackets), in this case a <div>
     * 4. Comments must be wrapped in brackets
